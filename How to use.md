# How to use the system.

Using the system should be easy, but may be hard because theres not that much coding to do.
#
The system uses it's OWN coding language. Right now (there are 2 languages you can use, 1 is under construction.)
#

## Comment Mode
Comment mode is where you can freely type, but cannot use functions or commands. To use this, your input must start with a "//" in line (1).

## (systemusage)
this command is being worked on.

"systemusage" will let you access the system usage of your computer. After executing, it will run the system, else, it will return with an mistaken error.

Other info coming soon.
